**Autonomous Vehicle Sensor Data Anomaly Detection**

Welcome to the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Sensor Data Anomaly Detection repository! This project is dedicated to advancing the detection of anomalies within sensor metadata collected from autonomous vehicles. Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of sensor data is critical for the safe operation of AVs. Through this repository, we aim to provide a robust framework and dataset for developing and evaluating anomaly detection models tailored to this purpose.

 _Features_
 
  Sensor Dataset: A rich collection of time-stamped sensor metedata readings from AVs, capturing data from LiDAR, radar,and cameras across diverse environmental conditions and driving scenarios.
  Preprocessing Scripts: Utilize our Python scripts for data cleaning, normalization, and preparation, making the data ready for analysis with various anomaly detection algorithms.
  Anomaly Detection Models: Dive into our machine learning models designed for anomaly detection in multivariate time series data. This includes both unsupervised algorithms, like Isolation Forest and Autoencoders, and supervised methods for datasets with labels.

  _Applications_

  This project is an invaluable resource for researchers, data scientists, and engineers focusing on enhancing the security, safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles through advanced anomaly detection, including applications in:

  Predictive Maintenance: Early identification of sensor anomalies signaling possible system failures.
  Operational Safety: Improvements in AV operational safety through the timely detection of data anomalies affecting decision-making algorithms.
  Cybersecurity: Detection of anomalies that could indicate cybersecurity threats, including sensor spoofing or data tampering.
